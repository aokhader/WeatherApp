# React Weather

This is a weather app built using ReactJS, which uses OpenWeatherMap and GeoDB APIs for autocompletion and weather data.
I used npx to create the react app and used two other packages: react-accessible-accordion (for the dropdown area for the upcoming days) and react-select-async-paginate (to allow for the autocompletion in the search bar).
